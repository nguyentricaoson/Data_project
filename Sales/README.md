# Sales Project
*By Nguyễn Trí Cao Sơn*

Welcome to my SQL sales project. The sample data is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data/), complying with [CC0 1.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

To access my work, please [click here](https://github.com/nguyentricaoson/Data_project/blob/main/Sales/Sales.sql).
### Purpose
In this project, I'll be looking at a sample sales data of a car manufacture and analyze some of the questions below:
- What is the total sales per year? How are sales over the years?
- Are sales affected by seasonal factors?
- What are the top selling products? Who are our most active customers? What is the average value of each order?
- Calculate the **retention rate** over the years.
- Calculate the average period between purchases for each customer.
- Show the top primary contact by sales each month.
### Findings
- Data only contain sales information of 2003, 2004 and the first 5 months of 2005.
- Sales are extremely high in October and November.
- Total sales over the years are increasing.
- Calculating retention rate with SQL sure took me a lot of brain power.
### Thoughts
After finishing my project, there are a couple of things I could have done differently:
- This data set can be used to answer a lot more questions. But I think keeping the project consise to showcase my ability to work with SQL is enough.
- I just learned how to interact with a pre-created table and database. I need to learn a lot more if I want to manage databases and tables, e.g. creating tables, inserting records, altering and updating tables, database optimization, etc.
