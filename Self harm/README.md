# Self Inflicted Deaths Project
Welcome to my data analysis project where I learn more about the [WHO intentional and self inflicted injuries](https://platform.who.int/mortality/themes/theme-details/topics/indicator-groups/indicator-group-details/MDB/self-inflicted-injuries) from 1950 to 2021 with data from 6 different regions with over 120 countries. The dataset is divided into 3 genders: male, female and unknown with age groups ranging from 0 to over 85 years old.

This dataset is collected from [WHO database](https://www.who.int/data), complying with [Copyright, Licensing and Permissions](https://www.who.int/about/policies/publishing/copyright) policy.
